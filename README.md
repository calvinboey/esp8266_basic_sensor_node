# basic_sensor_node
ESP8266 Sensor Node (DHT11, TSL2561, PIR)

## Getting Started

The recommended way is to use the platformio for compiling and uploading this project to the ESP8266. However, if you insist on using the Arduino IDE, do rename the files so that Arduino is able to compile it. 

### Prerequisites

You're need to have the basic libraries installed
* ESP8266 core for Arduino (automatically installed if using PlatformIO)
* DHT11 
* Adafruit's TSL2561 https://github.com/adafruit/TSL2561-Arduino-Library
